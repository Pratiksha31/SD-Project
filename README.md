Supply Chain Management Project
Supply Chain Management
This project is implemented to give riders or delivery boys shortest route 
and shortest time to reach target destination.
We first define the entire map of the area and then dynamically update the 
traffic congestion. As the traffic congestion changes, the rider is directed 
to take the path that would take him to destination as fast as he can.
We have used arrays and implemented this code using Djiktras algorithms.
